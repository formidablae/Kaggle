# Look at the Python expression below. What do you think we'll get when we run it? When you've made your prediction, uncomment the code and run the cell to see if you were right.

# R and Python have some libraries (like numpy and pandas) compare each element of the list to 2 (i.e. do an 'element-wise' comparison) and give us a list of booleans like `[False, False, True, True]`.
#
# Implement a function that reproduces this behaviour, returning a list of booleans corresponding to whether the corresponding element is greater than n.

    True if L[i] is greater than thresh, and False otherwise.

# Next to the Blackjack table, the Python Challenge Casino has a slot machine. You can get a result from the slot machine by calling `play_slot_machine()`. The number it returns is your winnings in dollars. Usually it returns 0.  But sometimes you'll get lucky and get a big payday. Try running it below:

# %% [code]
play_slot_machine()

# %% [markdown]
# By the way, did we mention that each play costs $1? Don't worry, we'll send you the bill later.
#
# On average, how much money can you expect to gain (or lose) every time you play the machine?  The casino keeps it a secret, but you can estimate the average value of each pull using a technique called the **Monte Carlo method**. To estimate the average outcome, we simulate the scenario many times, and return the average result.
#
# Complete the following function to calculate the average value per play of the slot machine.

# %% [code]


def estimate_average_slot_payout(n_runs):
    """Run the slot machine n_runs times and return the average net profit per run.
    Example calls (note that return value is nondeterministic!):
    >>> estimate_average_slot_payout(1)
    -1
    >>> estimate_average_slot_payout(1)
    0.5
    """
    pass
