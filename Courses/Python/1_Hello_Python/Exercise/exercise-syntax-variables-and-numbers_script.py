# Welcome to your first set of Python coding problems! 
# 
# If this is your first time using Kaggle Notebooks, welcome! 
# 
# Notebooks are composed of blocks (called "cells") of text and code. Each of these is editable, though you'll mainly be editing the code cells to answer some questions.
# 
# To get started, try running the code cell below (by pressing the ‚ñ∫ button, or clicking on the cell and pressing ctrl+enter on your keyboard).

# %% [code]
print("You've successfully run some Python code")
print("Congratulations!")

# %% [markdown]
# Try adding another line of code in the cell above and re-running it. 
# 
# Now let's get a little fancier:  Add a new code cell by clicking on an existing code cell, hitting the escape key, and then hitting the `a` or `b` key.  The `a` key will add a cell above the current cell, and `b` adds a cell below.
# 
# Great! Now you know how to use Notebooks.
# 
# Each hands-on exercise starts by setting up our feedback and code checking mechanism. Run the code cell below to do that. Then you'll be ready to move on to question 0.

# %% [code] {"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true}
from learntools.core import binder; binder.bind(globals())
from learntools.python.ex1 import *

print("Setup complete! You're ready to start question 0.")

# %% [markdown]
# ## 0.
# 
# *This is a silly question intended as an introduction to the format we use for hands-on exercises throughout all Kaggle courses.*
# 
# **What is your favorite color? **
# 
# To complete this question, create a variable called `color` in the cell below with an appropriate value. The function call `q0.check()` (which we've already provided in the cell below) will check your answer.

# %% [code]
# create a variable called color with an appropriate value on the line below
# (Remember, strings in Python must be enclosed in 'single' or "double" quotes)
____
color = "blue"

# Check your answer
q0.check()

# %% [markdown]
# Didn't get the right answer? How do you not even know your own favorite color?!
# 
# Delete the `#` in the line below to make one of the lines run. You can choose between getting a hint or the full answer by choosing which line to remove the `#` from. 
# 
# Removing the `#` is called uncommenting, because it changes that line from a "comment" which Python doesn't run to code, which Python does run.

# %% [code]
q0.hint()
#q0.solution()

# %% [markdown]
# The upcoming questions work the same way. The only thing that will change are the question numbers. For the next question, you'll call `q1.check()`, `q1.hint()`, `q1.solution()`, for question 2, you'll call `q2.check()`, and so on.

# ## 1.
# 
# Complete the code below. In case it's helpful, here is the table of available arithmetic operations:
# 
# 
# 
# | Operator     | Name           | Description                                            |
# |--------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
# | ``a + b``    | Addition       | Sum of ``a`` and ``b``                                 |
# | ``a - b``    | Subtraction    | Difference of ``a`` and ``b``                          |
# | ``a * b``    | Multiplication | Product of ``a`` and ``b``                             |
# | ``a / b``    | True division  | Quotient of ``a`` and ``b``                            |
# | ``a // b``   | Floor division | Quotient of ``a`` and ``b``, removing fractional parts |
# | ``a % b``    | Modulus        | Integer remainder after division of ``a`` by ``b``     |
# | ``a ** b``   | Exponentiation | ``a`` raised to the power of ``b``                     |
# | ``-a``       | Negation       | The negative of ``a``                                  |

pi = 3.14159 # approximate
diameter = 3

# Create a variable called 'radius' equal to half the diameter
____
radius = diameter / 2
# Create a variable called 'area', using the formula for the area of a circle: pi times the radius squared
____
area = pi * radius ** 2

# Alice, Bob and Carol have agreed to pool their Halloween candy and split it evenly among themselves.
# For the sake of their friendship, any candies left over will be smashed. For example, if they collectively
# bring home 91 candies, they'll take 30 each and smash 1.
# 
# Write an arithmetic expression below to calculate how many candies they must smash for a given haul.

# %% [code]
# Variables representing the number of candies collected by alice, bob, and carol
alice_candies = 121
bob_candies = 77

# Your code goes here! Replace the right-hand side of this assignment with an expression
# involving alice_candies, bob_candies, and carol_candies
